    3.  **Similarity Search & Context Retrieval:**
        * What: Search the vector database for the most similar documents (our FAQs) to the user's query embedding.
        * Why: To find relevant information from our knowledge base.
    4.  **Prompt Engineering for Empathetic Generation:**
        * What: Craft a prompt for the LLM that includes the retrieved context and instructs the LLM to answer empathetically, based *only* on the provided context, and in a customer-centric way.
        * Why: Guides the LLM to generate desired responses. Crucial for empathy and factual grounding.
        * Key Concepts: Prompt Engineering, Zero-shot/Few-shot learning (implicitly).
    5.  **LLM Interaction:**
